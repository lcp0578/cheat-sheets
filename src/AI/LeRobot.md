## LeRobot: Making AI for Robotics more accessible with end-to-end learning
- https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot
- LeRobot aims to provide models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry to robotics so that everyone can contribute and benefit from sharing datasets and pretrained models.

- LeRobot contains state-of-the-art approaches that have been shown to transfer to the real-world with a focus on imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

- LeRobot already provides a set of pretrained models, datasets with human collected demonstrations, and simulation environments to get started without assembling a robot. In the coming weeks, the plan is to add more and more support for real-world robotics on the most affordable and capable robots out there.

- LeRobot hosts pretrained models and datasets on this Hugging Face community page: huggingface.co/lerobot
