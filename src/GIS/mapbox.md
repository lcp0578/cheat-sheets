#### Mapbox vs OpenLayers
- MapBox supports only one projection, spherical Mercator or pseudo Mercator (EPSG:3857) which is the de-facto standard for maps on the web. OpenLayers supports many. 
- OpenLayers has better support for OGC standards such as WMS and WFS. MapBox has better support for vector tiles and fast rendering using webgl. 
- OpenLayers has a broader and more complete feature set. MapBox takes advantage of newer technologies
