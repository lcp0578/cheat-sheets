## AssetMapper: Simple, Modern CSS & JS Management
- The AssetMapper component lets you write modern JavaScript and CSS without the complexity of using a bundler. Browsers already support many modern JavaScript features like the import statement and ES6 classes. And the HTTP/2 protocol means that combining your assets to reduce HTTP connections is no longer urgent. This component is a light layer that helps serve your files directly to the browser.
