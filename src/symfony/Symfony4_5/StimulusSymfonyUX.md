## Stimulus & Symfony UX
- As simple as the above example is, instead of building your application inside of app.js, we recommend Stimulus: a small JavaScript framework that makes it easy to attach behavior to HTML. It's powerful, and you will love it! Symfony even provides packages to add more features to Stimulus. These are called the Symfony UX Packages.
