## Rate Limiter
- A "rate limiter" controls how frequently some event (e.g. an HTTP request or a login attempt) is allowed to happen. Rate limiting is commonly used as a defensive measure to protect services from excessive use (intended or not) and maintain their availability. It's also useful to control your internal or outbound processes (e.g. limit the number of simultaneously processed messages).
- The RateLimiter component was introduced in Symfony 5.2.
