- https://babeljs.io/
- Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:
	- Transform syntax
	- Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
	- Source code transformations (codemods)
	- And more!
