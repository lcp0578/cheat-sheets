- Overview
	- Sub-second queries at any scale
		- Execute OLAP queries in milliseconds on high-cardinality and high-dimensional data sets with billions to trillions of rows without pre-defining or caching queries in advance.
	- High concurrency at the lowest cost
		- Build real-time analytics applications that supports 100s to 100,000s queries per second at consistent performance with a highly efficient architecture that uses less infrastructure than other databases.
	- Real-time and historical insights
		- Unlock streaming data potential through Druid's native integration with Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis as it supports query-on-arrival at millions of events per second, low latency ingestion, and guaranteed consistency.
