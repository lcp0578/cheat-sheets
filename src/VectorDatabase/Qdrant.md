- Qdrant “is a vector similarity search engine that provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points (i.e. vectors) with an additional payload.” 
- You can think of the payloads as additional pieces of information that can help you hone in on your search and also receive useful information that you can give to your users.
- You can get started using Qdrant with the Python qdrant-client, by pulling the latest docker image of qdrant and connecting to it locally, or by trying out Qdrant’s Cloud free tier option until you are ready to make the full switch.
